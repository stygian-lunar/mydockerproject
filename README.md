OVERVIEW OF MY PROJECT:

This project is basically a docker interface for the users. This provides users the option to perform specific tasks using docker without knowing the actual commands . The code is an integration of python and linux . Upon running in terminal options appear , the user gives the input what he wants to do . And depending upon the input given by the user different tasks are performed . This makes it easy for the user to interact and use docker containers efficiently .
